"""Routing report — observed routes, usage, and cache behavior.

Reads the live decision log written by `server/jev_server.py`
(`~/.codex/codex-router/jev-router-live.jsonl`: one JSON line per decision, with
`at`, `gate`, `tier`, `conf`, `depth`, `model`, `effort`, `speed`, `jev_ms`,
`total_ms`, ...) and prints, over a window of N days:

  - the distribution of the models/tiers served (luna / terra / sol / astra, plus the
    Codex-dry tandem when it took over);
  - the share of turns served by the cheapest tier (luna);
  - the gates the policy went through (`apply`, `hold(sol)`, `hold(luna_step)`,
    `codex_dry(...)`, ...);
  - the median latency (end-to-end and Jev's own decision time);
  - a published API rate-card comparison using the same synthetic reference
    input for each route, not observed per-turn cost or quota.

It also reads the user's local backtest aggregate when present. That aggregate
is private usage-derived data and must not be copied into a public repository.

Usage:
    python3 server/report_routing.py                  # last 7 days, text table
    python3 server/report_routing.py --days 30
    python3 server/report_routing.py --days 7 --json  # machine-readable

Rate-card reference (not measured cost)
--------------------------------------
The relative-rate table assigns each call the same synthetic reference input:
one million uncached input tokens and no output. It exists only to compare
published input rates; it does not represent the user's traffic or actual call
cost. New attempts may also include observed-token credit-rate estimates where
a published rate is available. GPT-6 credit usage remains unpriced here.

    GPT-6: astra $10/$50 · sol $2/$10 · luna $0.10/$0.50
    GPT-5.6 historical: sol $4/$20 · terra $2/$12 · luna $0.20/$1.20

GPT-6 list prices follow the official OpenAI model pages for
[`gpt-6-luna`](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-6-luna),
[`gpt-6-sol`](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-6-sol), and
[`gpt-6-astra`](https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/gpt-6-astra).
They are API prices, not ChatGPT credit rates; GPT-6 credit attempts remain
unpriced below.

One reference unit is the standard-speed GPT-6 Luna list rate for that synthetic
input. Historical Fast calls retain their API x2 multiplier according to the
logged speed; legacy Luna entries without a speed are assumed Fast. These
relative values are not measured usage, account charges, quota, or savings.
The native-only comparison excludes external fallback calls.

Assumptions worth reading before quoting a number:
  - token volume per call is held constant across scenarios; changes in effort,
    retries, success rate, and Jev cost are not modelled;
  - prompt-cache invalidation from switching models mid-thread is not modelled
    (per-model caches), so real-world savings can be lower;
  - the baselines are API-equivalent counterfactuals, not invoices: no turn is
    re-served, and Codex-dry turns (served by the Go tandem, off-peak rates) are
    compared against native tiers they did not consume in the mixed report.
  - ChatGPT quota/credit accounting is not API USD billing; neither comparison
    measures actual Codex quota saved.
